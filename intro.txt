  
Hi I'm Sergeant Charlotte LaVolal. And you must be...\Hi I'm Edvin Spieler, the reporter.*\Ummmm... don't you know who I am?*\
Please, call me Charlie. You're here for an interview yes?\Is now a good time? I know you must be busy...*\Correct. Does here work for the interview?*\
That's okay. Now works. Fire away!\Do you man the station by yourself?*\Do you miss anyone?*\
Kinda. There is another soldier on the station. Their focus is more on mantinaing the equipment.\Oh cool! Do you guys get along?*\Do you worry about the alien threat?*\
I say we work pretty well together. We've fallen into a good rhythm on the station.;
I feel very confident about the abilities of my teams ability.;
I miss my parents from time to time. I didn't have any really solid friends until I came up here.\Do you get along with the rest of the crew?*\Do you miss any of your siblings?*\
Yeah! We work pretty well together! I find that we complement and support each other really well.;
I have a sister... but I don't really want to talk about her.;
I guess so. Ask away!\What do you do in your free time on the station?*\How did you get into this line of work?*\
When I'm not on call, I find myself reading a lot, mainly comic books.\Is it just reading you busy yourself with?*\Wow, what a nerd.*\
I also like to keep a menagery of bugs, surprisingly.;
Ugh, rude.;
My parents were actually Spacecraft attendants and so I got a lot of exposure through that.\Ah! Keeping up the family tradition I see.*\Apple doesn't fall far huh?*\
I mean. I got myself where I am regardless of any influence from my parents... Thank you very much.;
I guess you could say that...;
Well, we heard that a reporter was coming today. Wasn't expecting one with attitude!\I thought my name had been passed along. I'm Edvin Spieler.*\Let's start over. I'm Edvin Spielier with Nova Weekly.*\
It's okay. We've become a major hub for deep space communications, so things get lost.\So, how long have you been at Hutton Orbital?*\Well, just... do better.*\
I have been on the station for about 4 years and 6 months now.\Wow! That's a really long time.*\Jeez. You look great for being isolated for so long.*\
Theres another person stationed on Hutton with me actually and I find their company quite enjoyable.;
Oh! Thank you!;
Do better?! Do YOU want to do my job? I can show you how EASY it is...\I'm sorry!*\I'm just saying...*\
Apology somewhat accepted...;
Are you usually this annoying?;
I'm Sergeant Charlotte LaVolal. I'm stationed here on Hutton Orbital\You pilot one of the robots right?*\ I know that already...*\
I pilot the Caridina. She's a big beast, but reliable and gets the job done.\It's an honor to meet you.*\The Iupus is my favorite robot.*\
It's always nice to meet a fan!;
That is piloted by my coworker! She's very talented.;
Were you dropped as a child?\Were you?*\Yes.*\
UGH! YOU'RE SO ANNOYING!;
Oh... that explains a lot.;
